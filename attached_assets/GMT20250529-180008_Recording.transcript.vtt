11
00:01:26.124 --> 00:01:35.859
Brian Olson: Stayed one day at planet Hollywood before we actually got an Airbnb. It was that we met up with a a group and actually did a fancy football draft out there. So

12
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.080
Brian Olson: what?

13
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.420
Brian Olson: Yeah.

14
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.529
Joe: Do know. Football starts in September.

15
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.750
Brian Olson: Yeah, this is a quite, quite the League. It's a dynasty. So we.

16
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.509
Joe: All right.

17
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.559
Brian Olson: It's a rookie draft. So.

18
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.470
Joe: Okay, I've I've done dynasty. One of the guys here does a lot of it. I I stuck with the old school old school draft.

19
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.070
Brian Olson: Yeah. The redraft. Yeah.

20
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.450
Joe: Well, we used to do it all used to be all in person, but now we got people came in Bermuda.

21
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.349
Joe: Canada states. So it's a little hard, yeah, a little hard to pull it off.

22
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.570
Brian Olson: I imagine.

23
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.739
Joe: All right. I'm gonna there's Randy.

24
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.550
Joe: and just for your reference. Brian Shay has worked with the bank for many, many years, probably 15 years.

25
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.633
Brian Olson: Wow! Okay.

26
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.910
Brian Olson: Terrific.

27
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.719
Joe: Him and Randy are in constant communication.

28
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.879
Brian Olson: Love it all right.

29
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.150
Joe: I just had a really nice call with Andrea.

30
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.930
Brian Olson: Oh, terrific, awesome! On the installation side.

31
00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:02.100
Joe: Yeah, quick question for you to do the trial David, our engineer, just email, me, do we have to officially be a partner for him to download the agent.

32
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.360
Brian Olson: No, no.

33
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.580
Joe: Okay.

34
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.379
Joe: Yeah. Cause he had asked me a question about it. I'll I'll just.

35
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.969
Brian Olson: Yeah, no, not a worry at all. Nothing like that. So you could set it up as soon as today if you'd like.

36
00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:15.759
Joe: Okay, hey? Randy?

37
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.500
Randy’s iPhone: Hi! How's it going.

38
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.980
Joe: Good, how you doing.

39
00:03:19.444 --> 00:03:25.529
Randy’s iPhone: Pretty good. I'm just trying to log in right now. I have the team with me, but we're trying to bring it on the big screen.

40
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.160
Joe: Okay, please.

41
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.720
Joe: You had.

42
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.144
Randy’s iPhone: Who

43
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.340
Joe: You see it see it on the big screen better than the iphone.

44
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.095
Randy’s iPhone: Right now. So

45
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.129
Randy’s iPhone: the iphone zoom. But I just want to let everyone know trying to get the big screen.

46
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.419
Brian Olson: Right on.

47
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.700
Joe: All good.

48
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.510
Joe: Do you sneak in any golf games out there.

49
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.761
Brian Olson: That's funny. You mentioned it 1st time I've golfed in 11 months. We snuck out to

50
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.310
Brian Olson: a little golf course about 10 miles outside of Vegas. So

51
00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:28.720
Brian Olson: my game was rough for the 1st 7 holes before I got my swing back.

52
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:42.629
Brian Olson: But it was a really good time, and it's beautiful out there. You just, you know you can't hit it. If you miss the fairway or miss the rough you're in trouble. You're in the desert. So yeah, it's it was a good time, though.

53
00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:02.229
Joe: Yeah, I was there 3 times last year, you know, once for business and a couple of social events. And I'm good. I don't need to go back in 2025.

54
00:06:02.605 --> 00:06:04.860
Brian Olson: You got your fixing? All right?

55
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:18.214
Brian Olson: Yeah, it's always a. It's a great city to go for one or 2 days. And then after that I'm like, all right, I I gotta get out of there.

56
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.979
Joe: Do you drive? Do you drive or fly?

57
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:33.480
Brian Olson: No, I I always fly, but I do have a a buddy who lives near me, who meets up for that fantasy football draft, and he is deathly afraid of flying, so he literally will do the, I think, like 8 or 9 h.

58
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.470
Joe: I will!

59
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.840
Brian Olson: Yeah.

60
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.400
Joe: Roof.

61
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.270
Brian Olson: So.

62
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.480
Joe: So yeah.

63
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.980
Joe: Long went for a weekend.

64
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.050
Brian Olson: Yeah, it's quite the journey, but

65
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.270
Brian Olson: guess it's worth it in the end.

66
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.070
Joe: Show you. There.

67
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.879
Shea: Hi, Joe, good afternoon. Everyone. Yeah. I'm here. Can you hear me?

68
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.610
Brian Olson: We got you.

69
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.230
Joe: Gotcha.

70
00:06:56.424 --> 00:06:59.930
Shea: Okay. Sorry. Just keep my mic on for a minute. Here. I've got a bit of a cough.

71
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.110
Joe: Just

72
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.420
Joe: Hopefully Randy gets it set up in a minute. We'll be good to go.

73
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.350
Shea: Okay. I'll be here.

74
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.600
Joe: Right.

75
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.619
Brian Olson: Joe, how often are you able to get out on the on the links.

76
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.190
Joe: I've been playing a you know.

77
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:58.163
Joe: once every couple of weeks here since I got back. When I was in Cayman for a couple of years, and

78
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:05.603
Joe: they only have one course there and plus for about 5 months a year. It's too darn hot.

79
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.029
Joe: It's not dry heat down there it is.

80
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.740
Brian Olson: Yeah.

81
00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:10.730
Joe: Can only only imagine.

82
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.496
Joe: So, yeah, I'm playing Saturday.

83
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:20.499
Joe: yeah, I I you know there's a lot more courses in Bermuda thankfully. So I'll get out every once in a while.

84
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.930
Brian Olson: That's awesome.

85
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:30.220
Brian Olson: Yeah. I wonder what what the what it was like in in the Cayman Islands. But you said it was. There's only literally one course. There.

86
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.902
Joe: There's there's 1 18 hole course

87
00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:39.890
Joe: and it's not bad. It's flat and the Ritz has a 9 hole course.

88
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:40.390
Brian Olson: Gosh!

89
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.609
Joe: Here you got a couple of classics, some really couple of nice, really beautiful courses.

90
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.440
Brian Olson: Awesome.

91
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.444
Randy’s iPhone: Sorry about that.

92
00:08:51.210 --> 00:09:02.430
Randy’s iPhone: our computers are not liking zoom right now. We do things on on teams. So the big computers not log in but my team, which is probably just log in with their phones. So we'll all be here.

93
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:18.719
Brian Olson: The other thing we could do is if I don't have access to my team's account right now. But if one of you creates a teams meeting and sends the invite to everybody that needs to join myself and Joe included. I'll be happy to join that, and then we can do it that way. It's up to you.

94
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:28.300
Joe: I mean, I can do that, Randy, in 5 in 5 min. I just need I need to know who all I mean. I guess, Randy, I could just send it to you, and you could present, and then say.

95
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.970
Randy’s iPhone: To Tamara.

96
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.699
Randy’s iPhone: Oh, Tamara is actually doing it right now. Actually.

97
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.150
Joe: Okay.

98
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:45.077
Randy’s iPhone: I can accept the teams invite, and then me, Randy and Sam are all here. So if you create the meeting, I'll join, and there's 3 of us in the room.

99
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.050
Joe: One sec.

100
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.650
Joe: I'll set it for 3, 10

101
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.380
Joe: man.

102
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.629
Joe: Alright! Give me a sec. Sorry.

103
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.599
Brian Olson: No worries go for it.

104
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.260
Joe: I know I know how to do teams meetings.

105
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.649
Joe: Alright. Give a sec, so we'll set it for

106

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.900
Joe: Shay.

108
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.549
Joe: Okay, sure, I got it 3, 15.

109
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.380
Joe: Oh, sorry, guys, I didn't put in the subject, but you'll see it.

110
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.929
Randy’s iPhone: Oh, that's fine!

111
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.160
Joe: So I can just cancel. Can we just

112
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.909
Joe: start again? Yeah, hang up and start again. Type of thing is that best.

113
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:26.825
Randy’s iPhone: Yep.

114
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.570
Brian Olson: Perfect. Alright. Well, I'll see you all over there.

115
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.720
Joe: Yep, thanks.
